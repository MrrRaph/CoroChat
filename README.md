> This program is a desktop application. <br />
> It integrates the client and the server which are communicating each other through HTTP Routes. <br />
> The client fetches and posts data from/to the server which returns JSON-Encoded responses.
> The client is a Whatsapp-Like application.
> The project was carried out using the scrum method.

> It's written in __Java programming language including some libraries like so:__
+ [JDBC Oracle DB](https://www.oracle.com/fr/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc.html)
+ [Java FX 11](https://openjfx.io/)
+ [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)

## Note: 
> To be able to launch the LoginView, you must configure javaFX <br />
> Go to:  Run > Edit configuration > LoginView > VM option
>
> Inside the VM option text zone in IntellJ, add the location of the javaFX library as the example below:

    --module-path 
    /Path/To/javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib 
    --add-modules 
    javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

## Presentation: 

How does CoroChat desktop app works ? 
We chose to show an use case where three users will connect and chat together.
> Thierry Khamphousone : Yulypso
> RaphaÃ«l Dray : MrrRaph
> Felicia Ionascu : FeliciaIonascu

### Main menu
Here is the main menu where users can sign in or go to sign up panel. 
<img align="center" width="900" height="560" src="./files/pictures/1MainMenu/LoginView.png"/>

### Sign up 
Thierry would like to access the CoroChat room. Firstly, he has to sign up. 
<img align="center" width="900" height="560" src="./files/pictures/2SignUp/1SignUp.png"/>

> Check:
> first name: cannot contains number
> last name: cannot contains number
> email: email format without capital letters
> pseudo: Cannot start with a number
> password: must contains at least 1 lowercase letter, 1 uppercase letter, 1 number and 1 special character

Press "Get started to sign up".

If an user tries to create an account with an existing email or pseudo, a pop up appears to alert the user.

<img align="center" width="900" height="560" src="./files/pictures/2SignUp/3PopUpError1.png"/>

> Email already exists.

<img align="center" width="900" height="560" src="./files/pictures/2SignUp/4PopUpError2.png"/>

> Pseudo already exists.


Data are stored in the Oracle Database.

> 3 lines has been added for our three users
> Password are secure thanks to the blowfish encryption

### Connect from the login view
For an existing account, the user can connect on the CoroChat room from the Login View thanks to his email and password.

<img align="center" width="900" height="600" src="./files/pictures/3ConnectLoginView/1SignIn.png"/>

If an user with the same email is already connected a pop up appears to alert the user.

### CoroChat Room
Our three users are now connected on the CoroChat room. They will now try to communicate through the interface.
 
<img align="center" width="600" height="700" src="./files/pictures/4ChatView/1.png"/>

FeliciaIonascu starts by sending a message. 

<img align="center" width="900" height="600" src="./files/pictures/4ChatView/2.png"/>

Then Yulypso and MrrRaph reply. 

<img align="center" width="900" height="600" src="./files/pictures/4ChatView/3.png"/>
> You can use emoticon to communicate your feeling like MrrRaph!

FeliciaIonascu wrote something wrong by mistake: "OrientEEEE" and now she is trying to delete the message.

<img align="center" width="900" height="600" src="./files/pictures/4ChatView/4.png"/>

<img align="center" width="900" height="600" src="./files/pictures/4ChatView/6.png"/>

Here we can find out that the message has been correctly deleted from the database.

<img align="center" width="1000" height="200" src="./files/pictures/4ChatView/7.png"/>

### Disconnect
Now the users would like to disconnect from the CoroChat room. 

<img align="center" width="1200" height="700" src="./files/pictures/4ChatView/8.png"/>

> to disconnect, each user has to click on the top right button.
> to leave the app, each user has to click on the top left red button.
> to reduce the screen, each user has to click on the top yellow button.

After this, disconnected users are back to the Login panel.

### Logger
Within our project source code, we added a logger to log every information, warning or errors. 
Here are some examples. 

<img align="center" width="550" height="50" src="./files/pictures/6Log/Log1.png"/>

> logger in the server INFO
> INFO: information about what happened

<img align="center" width="733" height="50" src="./files/pictures/6Log/Log2.png"/>

> logger in the client INFO and WARNING
> INFO: information about what happened
> WARGNIN: Client error

<img align="center" width="1310" height="300" src="./files/pictures/6Log/Log3.png"/>

> logger in the client INFO, WARNING and ERROR
> INFO: information about what happened
> WARNING: Client error
> ERROR: Databse error

### Technical debt

+ We could not implement the .jar executable from the mvnw script, so we provided it with the IntellJ build.
